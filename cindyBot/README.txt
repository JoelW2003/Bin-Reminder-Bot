To start bot, open a command terminal, cd into directory and run program.
'python bot.py'

'rent' db is called 'rent' but includes tables for both rent and bin collections. Old
rent/bin collections do not need to be removed from the table because the program
will ignore them. To add new entries, I have been using
"DB Browser (SQLite)".
